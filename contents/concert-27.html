<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Im Rauschen, cantabile“ is a delirium for double bass and electronics base on the piece „Im Rauschen Rot“ for double bass, percussion quartet and electronics premiered 2010 by Edicson Ruiz and the Drumming - Grupo de Percussão.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">„Im Rauschen, cantabile“ describes a state of constant tension. An organic tension where uncertainty plays an important role. The sounding environment of the piece is constructed like a two voice composition between melodies and sounds of percussive nature. It describes a movement between abstraction and empirical perception.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Controlled, modulated, and spatialized live by an assortment of theremin, joystick, brainwave, and pressure sensors, this 4-channel EuroRack modular synthesizer solo will feature: three Qu-Bit Nebulae modules (each running and rendering, in real-time, voltage-controlled versions of Boulanger’s classic "Trapped in Convert" Csound instruments, and a suite of new custom “Qu-Bit Csound” orchestras); plus two Thonk Music Thing Modular Radio Music modules (each playing a number of pre-rendered custom Csound orchestras as .AIF audio files); plus, two Audio Damage ODIO modules (allowing for the modular system’s audio to be sent to, and returned from two iPads running two Boulanger Labs Csound for iOS apps - csGrain, and csSpectral, that are being used for real-time Phase Vocoding and other Csound-based audio processing).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This newly composed, and completely re-designed solo version of the work was written to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the world premiere of Boulanger’s classic “Trapped in Convert”. "Back in the summer of 1979, when I composed "Trapped in Convert" at the EMS Studio at MIT using Barry Vercoe’s "music11" language, and then revised it at the MIT Media Lab in 1986 to serve as a beta-test suite for Vercoe’s new "Csound" language, I modeled all my sounds on those I would create in my home studio with my ARP 2600 analog synthesizer. Now, some 40 years later, and to celebrate the 40th anniversary of composition, I have been able to return to the modular synthesizer; to come full circle – but this time, I am making Csounds on the modular thanks to the design and commercial availability of the amazing Nebulae module from Qu-Bit Electronics, (the Nebulae is a EuroRack synthesizer module built around a Raspberry Pi running the latest version of Csound under the hood!). And so, as you might well imagine, I am incredibly excited by the fact that this old “Dinosaur” is no longer “Trapped” and I look look forward to letting her loose at the 5th International Csound Conference, here in Italy, and taking her out for a run around the hall!"</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Superstring Theories is based on a physical model of a string, divided between the two musicians. It is a one-string two-player instrument. Each of them has part of the string, can tune it and inject energy into it by means of contact microphones, while the injected energy also resonates in the other musician's part of the string. When one part is tunes, this also affects the tuning of the other part. Each part has it's own resonance circuit, as well as the global one spanning the whole string. This means that some local control over pitch is maintained even when the other part of the string is retuned. For some performances of the piece, the musicians are geographically separated locations, connecting the pieces of the string together over remote network connections, In other performances, the two musicians are located at separate ends of the same room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The piece is an improvisational duo between the Half-Physler model and Alma. The Half-Physler is a prototype of a hybrid singe-reed instrument. The excitation mechanism of the instrument is based on actual instrument parts (mouth-piece, saxophone reed, ligature), but the tube is simulated on the Bela board. A bending sensor is directly attached to the reed which allows a large variety of possibilities for stimulating the reed, for example rubbing the reed against different materials and surfaces like foam, rubber, wood, metal, which produce a rich pallet of different and complex timbres, while the simulated tube is controlled by sliders. Alma is an instrument for improvising and composing. It receives the audio input from the Half-Physler, which is analyzed for sounding units of four different sizes, that are played back in different ways by a player using a MIDI keyboard.</span></p>
